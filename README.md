### Abstract
Hidden from the general student population is the process by which courses are modified, added, and removed from the course catalog. However, the process is a well known yet tedious endeavor for the faculty involved, involving the use of an antiquated web tool with the look and feel of something from the 90s, but with none of the nostalgia. The Luther Course Proposal project is aimed at alleviating this pain by developing a new application for faculty to use during this process. Using modern software technologies – namely Angular JS, Mongo DB, CSS3, and Java – Luther Course proposal implements many of the missing features in the current application: automatically loading data, tracking approval progress, and upgrading look and feel, to name a few. dThis web based application will allow Luther faculty to easily add, modify, and drop courses while monitoring their progress through the course approval process in a central application, thus facilitating the improvement of educational programs here at Luther. 


### Current developers
* Aaron Herman 

### Future Improvements

* The icon should be changed to something other than the Luther
    Norsehead. Same as our conversation related to KATIE.

* "Norse Key" is actually two words though it appears as one word
    within the application.

* Feature request from Jon Lund to be able to enter the study away
    information within this new application.

* Feature request from Alexandra White to be able to upload
    attachments, for example for Paideia 450.

* Feature request from Ruth Berger to email notifications related to
    the process. Unclear as to exactly when she would want to be notified.
