Project : APC Interface

Description: 
  The Academic Program Committee (APC) is currently using a web based interface to send in requests to add, drop, and modify academic courses here at Luther College. This interface, however, is lacking in numerous aspects. The main issue with this interface is the cumbersome and complex operations a user needs to perform when they wish to perform any operation. For example, when any change request is made to any course, the owner of the change request, or the person who submitted the request to the committee, needs to email the chair of the academic division and the chair of the APC to alert them of the change request. Also, when proposing modifications to a course, the user must re-enter all the information in the web form instead of modifying certain fields. Our app would ease the pain of suggesting modifications to the courses for the APC. 
  
  Our app would provide numerous views that would allow all faculty to submit course change proposals and follow a request through the entire approval process. It would eliminate the necessity for manually emailing the chair of the division for the course that was added, dropped, or modified and the chair of the APC. We would provide a dashboard in which faculty could log into to view all the current course revisions under consideration, which would be filterable by division, department, class level, etc. Under each proposal, we would add a forum feature so faculty could comment on proposed changes to suggest additions, corrections, or deletions to the proposed modification. We would provide a cleaner, easier to use interface that allows updates to pre-existing courses by laoding information into the form, facilitating adding a course by having some pre-selected options depending on the user's department, and view all pending course change requests. 
  
  Our minimal viable product (MVP) would consist of a user dashboard where the user would be able to see all pending requests, the approval stage of the requests they submitted, and the user's current profile. It would also include form pages to add, drop, and update courses. Eventually, we would incorporate a forum widget that would allow users to comment on pending requests. 
  
  The overall goal of this project is to alleviate the pain of members of the APC and faculty when submitting revisions to the courses at Luther College by providing a clean, user friendly web interface that facilitates the crucial operations in the academic program review process.
