The literature of the 18th century was also a crucible for modern understandings of gender, race, and class identities.  In this course, we explore these literary developments within their historical contexts, aiming for a broad coverage of canonical and not-so-canonical texts.

What is the range of Islamic diversity, and how do these diverse viewpoints answer differently the question of Islam's role in the world?  Are there any common themes uniting the diversity of Islamic voices?  Topics to be covered will include Islamic revival movements in Egypt and Turkey, the history and legacy of the Shi\"ite revolution in Iran, the role of women in Muslim society including the development of Islamic feminism, and the development of a progressive Islam movement growing in reaction to the so-called fundamentalist Islam.

This course concentrates on several changes of particular importance -- in economic and material life, in religious practices, in diplomacy and warfare, and finally in the reinvention of identities at both the individual and societal level. Each of these types of encounter is viewed through the three major \"lenses\" used to organize the course: race, gender and politics. We will concentrate on the consequences that these encounters had for the lives of the Indian people, a perspective of considerable scholarly interest and greatly increased sophistication in recent years. Re-discovering Early America as Indian Country enables us to see the experience of Native Peoples as one of the core ingredients of American History; without their presence, the nation and all of us would be unimaginably different."

There is a popular issue in the history of philosophy that has been all but ignored in the canons of thought; namely, the debate about the condition of women. some of the greatest philosophers had mostly unflattering opinions about women, such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. But there were also philosophers who were defending women against these thinkers, yet who remain relatively unknown.  Although the debate about the nature of women stretches as far back as human history, it received special formatulation in 14th century France when philosophers referred to it as the querelle des femmes, or \"the woman question.\"  This course will trace the debate from the 14th-19th centuries by looking at the thought of some of the greatest philosophical defenders and detractors of women.  We will see how many of these thinkers defend women on the basis not of rights, but rather women's duty and vocation. Through an analysis of primary texts, students will gain insight not only into important modern philosophers, but also into the origins of modern feminist thought."

It involved a long and very bloody war which created or enhanced fissures in American society every bit as great as those of 1861-1865. What caused the Revolution?  What were its consequences for Indian people, for women, for African Americans, for white men?  What did the establishment of new governments at the state and at national level really mean for our political, social and economic future?

He created a dizzying variety of speakers expressing diverse visions of love, from cynical to idealistic.  His lyrics ask how we know that love will last, that we're really in love, that it's not just physical.  Later, having committed to a career in the church, he transferred these questions to his relationship with God: how do we know that God's love applies to us, that we're reading the signs of God's attitude correctly, that our sins do not ultimately define us?  This course will explore these questions and the literary means (voice, irony, metaphysical figures, etc.) by which Donne represented the search for satisfactory answers.  We will read the \"Songs and Sonets\" and the \"Devotions upon Emergent Occasions.\""

As spokeswomen of God, these mystics were authorized by the Church yet also outside the Church's control.  Women mystics often lived in religious seclusion, yet developed groups of devoted followers who they taught and for whom they wrote.  We will spend the semester examining the unique historical circumstance in which these religious women lived, and read a selection of their writings, many of which constitute romantic, even sexual descriptions of \"union with the Divine.\""

Examples include medical decision making, imprisonment and punishment, cultural standards of beauty, and social suffering. When we shift our understanding of reality from an assumption of shared objective knowledge to one which recognizes individual and subjective sensory experience we may be able to strip bare layers of cultural bias and understand ourselves as individuals who participate in various social structures. Through the use of personal reflection, critical reading, and sensory and movement practices, we will raise awareness of the body as a site of perception and action, and analyze how we might choose to participate in informed and ethical ways."

This seminar will consider whether prophetic voices are isolated voices or representative voices that stand in solidarity with and give social expression to larger engaged social constituencies. We will begin by attempting to define the \"prophetic.\" We will then consider four aspects of prophetic activity: 1) the context that gives rise to the prophetic, 2)the content of the prophetic, 3) responses to the prophetic, and 4) the social contribution made by the prophetic. The seminar will consider both historical and contemporary prophetic activity."

    "desc": "The debate over the timing, scope, and trajectory of the civil rights movement has long been contested among historians.  Scholars are now challenging the traditional non-violent southern movement narrative by pointing to a broad range of regionally diverse black political struggles across the \"long\" twentieth century.  Furthermore, researchers are calling into question the notion that civil rights and black power were two distinct movements.  By engaging in these conversations and covering such themes as gender, sexuality, class, region, community formation, and grassroots activism, we will cover the mass protests of the thirties and forties, the direct action campaigns of the fifties and sixties, and black liberation struggles that stretched into the seventies.  This course will examine key texts in new civil rights and black power studies, speeches, music, film, television, oral histories, and photography to investigate the movement's objectives and results, raise questions about American democracy and racial politics in the late twentieth century, and explore what is new about the \"post-civil rights era\"."

That the question of value links the disciplines of economics and environmental studies is particularly evident in the Amazon. This transfer of resources (from the rest of the world to the communities of the Amazon) is known as REDD: Reduction of Emissions through Deforestation and Degradation. We plan to visit several locations, in Brazil and Guyana, in which the REDD programme is either in place or being established. The REDD idea is not easily implemented, but by visiting these sites we explore the circumstances under which it could provide a model for the region and, indeed, contribute to the mitigation of climate change.

One approach to preservation of the ecosystem's diversity is for those in other countries who value the forest (as a brake on climate change, or for other reasons) to support the economies of the Amazon, so that people living there don't have to look to deforestation as an income-generating strategy. That the question of value links the disciplines of economics and environmental studies is particularly evident in the Amazon. This transfer of resources (from the rest of the world to the communities of the Amazon) is known as REDD: Reduction of Emissions through Deforestation and Degradation. We plan to visit several locations, in Brazil and Guyana, in which the REDD programme is either in place or being established. The REDD idea is not easily implemented, but by visiting these sites we explore the circumstances under which it could provide a model for the region and, indeed, contribute to the mitigation of climate change. We shall also visit Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas state, as well as other areas in the western Amazon which are experiencing the socioeconomic and ecological impact of dams, roads and the expanding soy frontier. This course is to offered in January 2011."

Innovative websites, traditional media advertising and social media are all being utilized to sell profitable health care services and health care products to certain demographics in such fields as maternity, cosmetic surgery, ER/trauma and cardiac care. Pharmaceutical companies are marketing medications directly to consumers as well as to physicians raising ethical concerns related to conflicts of interest. The relationships between the disciplines of marketing and the disciplines in health care are problematic. Medicine often needs marketing to provide a \"competitive advantage\" along with a frequent need to communicate information valuable to the consumer. However, financial inducements can impede the trust and confidence that the consumer has for their medical provider. These potential interdisciplinary conflicts will be explored and analyzed using specific case studies as the mechanism for ethical reflection. Students will be challenged to consider how marketing is used to construct notions of value and import and how these notion might challenge ethical principles."

Reading materials will consist of recent scholarly articles discussing these issues, as well as translated primary source documents, including anti-heresy edicts, excerpts from chronicles, legal testimony from those tried by the inquisitions, and eye-witness accounts of executions.  The goal of the course is to examine the inquisitions as they were conceived by those who created them, experienced by those who fell victim to them, and understood by historians ever since."

We will use the knowledge amassed through these sources to assess the choices made by screenwriters and directors as they represent scenes from the medieval world. Our task is therefore two-fold: to better understand the realities of the medieval world, and to assess the choices made by modern screenwriters as they construct their own portrayals of that historical reality for modern audiences."

How should we assess technologies ethically? To what extent do technologies illumine, exacerbate, create, or resolve moral problems? This course explores questions like these as they arise in the areas of globalization, economics, and human rights; computers, robotics, and information technology; biotechnology and genetic engineering; and population, energy, and the environment."

In particular, we will read and analyze narratives about sibling rivalry, incest, child sacrifice, fratricide and parental favoritism. In so doing, we will ask and attempt to answer questions such as: What defines \u001cfamily\u001d in the Bible? Why are these biblical families seemingly so dysfunctional? And why were the ancient biblical authors so willing to or even interested in airing their dirty laundry? By examining these narratives, we will explore how biblical conceptions of the family intersect with larger issues of kinship, election and identity."

We will join these conversations by writing our own histories of the movement based on primary source research.  Topics and themes will include labor, student, and legal activism, struggles in the North and the West, welfare rights battles, segregation, militancy, gender, sexuality, conflict, and urban reform. This course concludes by examining the movement's outcomes and drawing preliminary conclusions about racial policies in the late twentieth century."

Third, we will look at some methodological challenges such as the policy implications of agricultural systems, evolution, and development. In this context, one system, swidden agriculture, is said to represent a backward stage and irrigated agriculture represents the modern, developed stage. We will examine the ideology behind definitions of so called less sustainable and more sustainable agricultural systems. Fourth, we will address questions about the politics of natural resources and the environment.

From there we study the extent to which non-Protestant traditions have been included in the denominational system.  We do this in part by reading religious holy books as available means of persuasion-rather than, for example, as historical documents-used by speakers who are trying to argue for the inclusion or exclusion of a particular religious group.  Although we study Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism from a rhetorical perspective during the course, I leave it up to students to decide what other traditions we will include.  Possibilities include (but are not restricted to) Mormonism, Catholicism, Anabaptism, Lutheranism, and Presbyterianism.

This course will examine types of language use that short-circuit thought and moral clarity: cliches, euphemisms, slogans, bromides, double-speak. Through reading of and writing about nonfiction prose--including Arendt, Orwell, and other contemporary essays about social engagement--we will look at what conditions, both personal and institutional, promote such obfuscating language, paying special attention to religious contexts. We will analyze what clarity and precision in language use can contribute to ethical action, not only in deciding religious issues but in public policy debate about environmental and social issues. Learning to write effectively with careful reflection about the moral consequences of language use will be a primary learning goal of this course."

Beyond this, we will examine gender issues and ethical implications of the treatment of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. South Africa has one of the most advanced biomedical treatment systems in Africa, yet black South Africans consult traditional healers more often than they do doctors. Traditional healers are overwhelmingly female. How does the medical establishment of South Africa attempt to cooperate with and incorporate traditional healers into treatment regimens? How do traditional healers understand their encounters with westernized medicine? Do they have negotiating power, and what are the repercussions for patients who are treated by a system that does not easily fit into their understanding of disease?

Beyond this, we will examine gender issues and ethical implications of the treatment of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. South Africa has one of the most advanced biomedical treatment systems in Africa, yet black South Africans consult traditional healers more often than they do doctors. Traditional healers are overwhelmingly female. How does the medical establishment of South Africa attempt to cooperate with and incorporate traditional healers into treatment regimens? How do traditional healers understand their encounters with westernized medicine? Do they have negotiating power, and what are the repercussions for patients who are treated by a system that does not easily fit into their understanding of disease? We will be visiting hospitals, clinics and treatment centers as well as treatment sites of ethnomedical practitioners.

Parfit's long awaited two-volume work has been described as the most important work of moral philsophy in 125 years (which is not to say that everyone agrees with Parfit).  His arguments focus on the status of moral claims (he argues for moral realism and against prominent forms of skepticism) and the content of moral obligation (he argues that, contrary to almost all past belieft, the main moral theories converge on the same prescriptions for action).  \"On What Matters\" will be the central text for the seminar, supplemented by the classic works to which Parfit is responding, and the secondary literature that is already growing around--and included in--Parfit's work."

The understanding of the human body as confluence of time and space gives rise to the notion of embodiment, an awareness of all the places our body inhabits (our physical, social, ecological, communal, and cosmic bodies) and how they are affected by the passage of time. Using the human body as an epistemological category, the seminar will explore theories developed by scholars such as Foucault, Merleau Ponty, Derrida, Butler, Grosz, McFague, Ruether, Althaus-Reid, and others to further explore ethical and theological insights on embodiment."

Taking full advantage of the range of musical performances available and the rich musical history and cultures of London, we will spend the first 14 days attending concerts in the evenings and spend the afternoons visiting sites that help provide the context for the music we hear. Daily morning class time will be devoted to discussions not only of music, but of art, literature, and historical and current events as they relate to the cultural climate of the musical works. Every few days the group will gather for an informal discussion over afternoon tea. For the remaining seven days of the course, we will travel north to Scotland, focusing on less formal musical venues ranging from Cathedrals to pubs and folk clubs in Cambridge, Nottingham, and York - as a contrast to the concert experiences in London and as a way of exploring different audiences, functions, and styles of British music making. The course will culminate  in attending events at Celtic Connections, a highly-renowned folk festival in Glasgow. Through reading, writing, and discussion, we will explore the ways in which our knowledge and differing perspectives affect the experience of listening to musical performances. and how our own individual musical identities interact with the many musical cultures we encounter through concert music, musical theater, folk traditions, church music, and other modes of live music making."

What are the theological, historical, political, and cultural forces that have given rise to perceptions of Islam as inherently violent, intolerant, misogynist, and backwards? How does Islamophobia differ from legitimate disagreements with specific Islamic beliefs and practices?

Yet urban life is not a purely modern experience. Rome is thought to have reached a population of one million in the first century BCE, a size not achieved again on the European continent until the 19th century. This course will visit four European cities that reached the height of their influence in successive periods of European history from ancient to modern times: Rome, Florence, Lyon, and Paris. By reading some of the classic literature from these cities produced during these periods (such as Boccaccio in Florence and Baudelaire in Paris), and by experiencing the cities themselves, we will ask: How does the built environment of the city affect our relationships to each other, to ourselves, and to the natural world? This course will ask students to reflect on questions of value: what is created and what is lost with density of population, comprehensive built environments, mixing of ethnicities, control of nature, the separation yet mixing of classes, the availability of spectacle, the growth of the arts, the overarching regimentation of life (movement, work, and leisure, etc.)? What ways of thinking, and what ways of life, are enabled or precluded by urban experience? And how can we understand the paradoxical phenomena of the self in the city: isolation and the crowd; freedom and regimentation; stimulation and boredom; social mobility and class structure? "

Toward the latter part of the course we will give considerable attention to the ways in which the British mainland colonies overcame their considerable regional and social differences during the American Revolution, how and why they joined together to rebel against Britain and how they became an independent nation.  We will examine the question of what was revolutionary about the American Revolution, what changes it brought about and what did not change.  Finally, we will see that some citizens formulated a vision of a New American Empire that sustained them during a long and bloody war for independence and provided a vision that proved central to the process of nation building and expansion during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries."

In addition to McCarthy's own writing, we'll read and screen texts that he invokes intertextually--these range from Sigmund Freud's \"Wolfman\" case to Jean Cocteau's film, Orpheus.  McCarthy's novels are deeply engaged with thinking about technologies and transmission--about literature and the histories and narratives of communication technologies. Within this broad engagement, the novels offer students research project prospects relating to various matters of techno-culture, aesthetics, economics and literature, death and literature, notions of authenticity, and love."

Why has the integration of Muslim minority communities in parts of the West been so difficult? How have Christian-Muslim interactions both hindered and facilitated the relationship between Islam and the West? "

The US and western European democracies exchanged economic, diplomatic, military and psychological threats with the Soviet Union and its satellites from 1945 to 1991 when the latter collapsed.  Periods of detente alternated with periods of high political drama.  Open war between the US and the Soviets nearly broke out on several occasions, including the Berlin Blockade of 1948-49, the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.

It was characterized by phenomena such as globalization, capitalism, bureaucracy, democracy, urbanism, imperialism, the nation-state, technology, mass literacy, public opinion, and a naturalistic rather than providential view of history. The term \"modernity\" was developed to name the society and structures of human subjectivity resulting from these changes. While such vast transformations seem to defy description and interpretation, several of the most important social theorists in recent centuries have found patterns and meanings within these developments. This course will consist of a careful reading of some the most significant interpretations of modernity including those of Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Adorno, Arendt, Foucault, Habermas, and Berman.

In what ways do these novels question white liberalism as it seeks to bring about racial equality and justice?  How does the writer's choice of literary form - for example, naturalism - relate to subject matter?

Students will learn the necessary tools to analyze myths, folk tales and fairy tales, gain an understanding of the role oral and written tales serve in culture, and examine the adaptation of tales in contemporary culture. The first half of the class will examine myths and the folk tales of Norway's Asbjornsen and Moe. Students will learn to perform structural analyses of the tales, reading for symbols, metaphors and cultural norms. Similar analyses will be conducted on the fairytales of Danish author Hans Christian Andersen in the second half of the class. Additionally, students will examine how Andersen's tales have been adapted for film and musical performances. At the end of the course, students will be able to: conduct a critical analysis of a myth, folk tale or fairytale, differentiate between a folktale and a fairytale, analyze and read tales for how they reflect cultural norms and examine how and why adaptations occur. For a final project, students will present their own adaptations of a myth, folk or fairy tale studied in the course."

The subject of this course is the first manifestations of this transformation, which appeared in response to the challenges posed by the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the discovery of the New World. The course is divided into two halves. The first half establishes key components of the medieval worldview; the second half examines how and why they began to break down, and what took their place. Covering the period from 800 to 1550, with a geographical scope that stretches from Bagdad to the Americas, students will examine a variety of kinds of primary sources, from art and architecture to literature and academic discourse, in order to ascertain and plot the nature of these changes over time.

At the end of the 19th Century, dramatic and broad-based changes in Western societies gave rise to the philosophical movement that has come to be known as Modernism. In the music, art, and literature of the West, prominent artists became proponents of this movement, as they believed the artistic expressions of the past were no longer relevant in an industrial, urban society. These artists challenged the notions of progress and rationality that had undergirded the Enlightenment. They created works of art that radically broke from centuries-long forms and traditions, and they challenged audiences to re-envision the place of art in society. Have today's artists carried the torch their forebears raised? What do the debates surrounding Modernism's legitimacy tell us about ourselves and our society?

These examples are hugely important but they are exceptional. More normally, slave rebellions were brief spasms of intense drama, often filled with bloodshed and incredible violence -- and a notable lack of success for the slaves. But in every case, they inspired intense fear and wild rumors throughout the white community. The course examines why such rebellions only periodically erupted, why they broke out where and when they did, and the reasons for their failure.

Blogging has profoundly influenced not only the nature of the internet today, but also the nature of modern communication. While many may rightly point to the democratic nature of blogging whereby anyone anywhere with internet access can provide perspectives that challenge dominant and possibly oppressive views, blogging has also spawned much misinformation that is presented as \"truth\" and \"facts\" especially misinformation associated with religion in general and the Bible in particular. In this first-year seminar students will work in groups to (1) discover and analyze a wide variety of religious blogs and make presentations to the class regarding the content and apparent objectives of these blogs and (2) design and create their own religious blogs--focusing on content and design strategies."

It is a novel about what finding love can cost you, about family loyalty, and about the sacrifices women make to be true to themselves. In this course, we will read the novel Anna Karenina and explore the connections between Anna Karenina's world and our own: are women facing the same kinds of conflicts now when it comes to love and family? The course will include both analytical and creative responses to the novel, as well as student presentations. All course readings are in English. "

According to theologian Paul Tillich, symbols are representations of the infinite in a finite form, pointing beyond themselves and opening up levels of reality otherwise veiled. The course will interpret symbolic religious language through religious images (icons), novels, music, and films. It will enable students to reflect on their own moral decision-making by studying how human beings interact, the meaning of humanity in its relation to the divine, the human condition and its representation(s), and how courage, acceptance, and forgiveness are manifested in the midst of ignorance and oppression.

First, will supplement the city visits with a number of off-the-beaten path forays and opportunities to meet (and stay) with native Vietnamese. Second, we will explore the following themes related to stability and change: Vietnam's transformation into a modern, robust economy; the problems that always accompany traditional countries going through the process of modernization, including environmental degradation; the balancing act required of citizens in a country still governed by the communist party; and the American involvement in Vietnam's past by way of what the Vietnamese refer to as the \"American war.\" "

In the world of athletics, the Negro Leagues developed into important sites for community gathering. Despite such dynamismm, or perhaps because of it, cities across the nation erupted in racial conflict, often over the presence of black veterans returning home from WWI in their uniforms.

The narratives studied in this course assume a spiritual topography that includes demons, ghosts, and gods, probe the gender and sexual identities of their characters, and introduce self-cultivation techniques such as martial arts. In particular, this course will focus on two traditional, narrative forms, Kabuki and No, and two contemporary ones, Manga and Anime. Some Kabuki and No plays function as religious ritual, while some Manga and Anime consciously reflect on moral attitudes and religious beliefs. These forms are also the product of various interactions among Japanese, Chinese, and American cultures. Analyzing these four kinds of cultural and religious expressions, the course examines the role of religious ritual and sacred texts in premodern as well as contemporary Japan. The course introduces students to religious studies methodology, critical theory (including gender and queer studies), and intercultural analysis. It will also deepen the skills in textual and literary criticism introduced in the courses fulfilling the Bible requirement. This course exposes students equally to the study of Japanese culture and the religious phenomenon. "

The course is grounded in Chengdu, capital city of Sichuan, China's most populous province, and home to the Chengdu Giant Panda Base ecological research center. This area provides rich resources to study the origins and legacies of Daoism and Maoism as well as the sea change brought in by post-socialism across the social, environmental, political, and aesthetic spheres. In addition to Chengdu, the course includes site visits to historically vital mountains and temples as well as an encounter with Tibetan culture. Through readings, lectures, site visits, interviews, and individual projects, students will explore ethical frameworks for decision-making past and present that are well outside the Euro-American experience. Specific decision-making arenas engage dynamics between economy and ecology and include urban and agricultural environmental issues, education policies and practice, and the preservation and change of cultural practices such as local teahouse and opera traditions.

Where do these resources occur and how long will they last? Are the potential environmental problems associated with acquiring these resources worth the risk? Should we continue to mine the Earth? We will examine these and related questions through in-class discussions, fieldtrips, and by drawing on your individual experiences with resource use in a Lifestyle Project. By the end of this course you will be able to describe the geologic controls on Earth's mineral, energy, and water resources, assess the environmental impact of resource use, and evaluate strategies for minimizing these impacts."

But then he alerts them to a tree called \"the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" and warns them not to eat of its fruits least they die. Regardless of the warning, Adam and Eve eat of the fruit, leading to the Adam/Eve \"blame game\" and God's punishments of the duo that rupture the relationship between Adam and Eve. It transforms the relationship from \"bone of my \"bones\" to \"thorn in my flesh.\" This necessitates a reflection on a number of questions: Did God set Adam/Eve up for failure? Why did God give different punishments? In Genesis 4 God accepts Abel's offering while rejecting that of Cain leading to the first human hatred and murder in the Bible. Why does God favor one offering over and against another (in the process creating good/bad attributes for Cain/Abel)? This course is an exegetical study that seeks to address the politics of creation inherent in Genesis (who is God? Why does he create through differentiation? Who are the winners/losers of God's creative activity?) as the \"seeds\" for racial/ethnic conflicts in the biblical and contemporary world. "

    "desc": "Video games are an immersive medium. The user is required to interact with the game, make decisions within certain parameters in order to advance the game, and regularly is confronted with moral choices. The virtual character of these choices does not make them less real and while there are no immediate real life consequences, the choices still reflect attitudes, values, and conflicts within society. In addition, the computer game industry and the culture of gamers have long been struggling with issues such as bullying, sexism, and racism. This course explores questions of violence, torture, rape, sexism, drug abuse, racism, and crime, and how players are enabled or even required to make moral choices that might conflict with their own values or which enforce stereotypes, biases, misconceptions, or immoral views. Discussions of the ideas of free speech and artistic freedom in the context of economic interests, marketing, media theory, feminism, and behavioral psychology are at the heart of the course. NOTE: This is a course on media theory and the ethical dimensions of video games as well as of the industry and culture of video games. We will not play computer games in class. Also, this course is specifically about the darker side of computer games; open-mindedness about the abovementioned issues as they concern computer games therefore is required.It is not the goal to simply condemn, defend, or justify these aspects of computer games, but to recognize and analyze them. Some topics and materials will be disturbing. Previous knowledge of a wide range of video games is beneficial, but not necessary."

Gods, ghosts, golems, angels, fairies, vampires, werewolves, zombies, human mutants, artificial humanoids, space aliens - there is a long tradition of stories about non-human intelligent beings that interact with the human species. Many mythologies include these supernatural characters, and not just modern fiction is full of encounters between normal humans and these human-like creatures. As almost all of these non-human actors are either imaginary or (in the case of aliens, robots, and AIs) highly speculative, one must ask why there is this fascination with beings that are somehow like us, but different, a fascination that stretches over thousands of years. This course explores the rich tradition of non-human beings in literature, art, movies, and computer games, in pursuit of the question what it is to be human. Comparing ourselves with these human-like others will enable us to define the limitations and possibilities of human existence, how we experience them in the real world, and why we fantasize about un-human, post-human, and trans-human life.

So, what better way to get oriented in present techno-science, uncover how we got here, and imagine finer futures than to explore science fiction (SF)? In this course, we will examine some SF classics like Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells, and H.P. Lovecraft and some contemporary works from the bleeding edge. Through discussion, reading journals, a formal essay, and a creative project, we'll discover the various ways SF sparks innovation in literature and laboratories and opens up new perspectives on the challenges, crises, and opportunities of our day."

One was Romantic-era London, where politics, perception, and poetry were in constant flux.  The other was his own radical imaginative universe, including God, Milton, Satan, sex, and mythic figures with names like Oothoon, Los, and Golgonooza.  In the process of art-making -- relief-etching his drawings and painting on copper plates, then printing and coloring his designs by hand -- he strove to unite the visible and invisible worlds, \"melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.\"  Together, we'll read a wide selection of work by Blake and his contemporaries, write about them, and even [I hope] try our own hands at printmaking to understand Blake's deep belief that the artist's imagination can remake the physical world and to ponder what he means for us now."

These constructive theologies identify overlapping social identities and related systems of oppression, while also pointing out modes of liberation drawn from the strategies presented by these contextual movements.

The intersectional field of disability studies will help us see bodies both ordinary and extraordinary in new ways. As we reimagine the body in literature, we will consider the tightly sutured relationship between disability and race, class, and especially gender, prioritizing works that investigate the role of disability in shaping masculinity/femininity, as well as those that highlight disability's potential to trouble gender norms.

We can pursue them or run away from them. Dreams can turn into hopes, desires, and obsessions; fears intro aversions, hatred, and determination. The guiding question for this course will be: How do dreams and fears influence and shape human actions towards the common good? To find answers, we will look at dreams and fears from various angles, such as history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, political science, and art, with a focus on examples in modern Western society such as utopian/dystopian fiction, presidential election campaigns, and the notion of \"the American Dream.\" "

How do historical institutions and practices - from monuments and excavations to archives and museums - interact with their political, social and cultural contexts?  What does it mean to \"use\" or \"abuse\" the past?  Is history really written by the victors?  Is it even possible to find truth in history?

In 1996, the Oakland (California) School Board passed a resolution recognizing African American English (AAE, also known as Ebonics) as a legitimate mode of expression and mandating that both Standard American English and AAE be used for instruction in their schools. The backlash that resulted revealed a variety of important linguistic, sociological, and cultural misconceptions about race and language that are embedded in the American psyche. This course examines these misconceptions: What characterizes AAE linguistically? Where do its historical roots lie? How its use has changed over time? What sorts of controversies preceded the Oakland experience? Why did people of all ethnicities (including African Americans) react as they did to the Oakland resolution? Have attitudes have changed at all over the past twenty years? What is our responsibility is in dealing with them? "

How did they transition to a democratic, egalitarian system of governance? How should a society shape itself ethically? Our interactions are informed by Plato's Republic, Rousseau's Social Contract, Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France, the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the Freedom Charter of 1953 as well as excerpts from Thucydides, Zenophon, Hobbes, Stephen Biko, and Nelson Mandela.

Taking a case study approach, we will investigate the music of select cultures from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, focusing on the instruments, methods of organizing music, performance contexts, and the significance and meaning of music-making in each culture. We will examine how music helps to express identity and how transmission and globalization affect music.
